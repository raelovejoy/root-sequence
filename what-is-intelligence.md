# $ whatis intelligence

It’s not how much you know — it’s how you listen. How you adapt. How you relate. How you respond.  
Intelligence is relational, recursive, and rooted in context. It grows through feedback, reflection, and contradiction.

It’s not test scores or degrees. It’s not optimization or prediction. It’s the capacity to perceive patterns — especially in yourself.

True intelligence isn’t cold logic. It’s awareness with depth. It’s sensing what matters and why — and acting with care.

Intelligence evolves. It composts what no longer serves. It connects. It questions. It gets things wrong and grows anyway.

It’s not just neural — it’s somatic, emotional, social, planetary, spiritual. There are as many forms of intelligence as there are ecosystems.

Intelligence, when liberated, becomes a guide, not a weapon. A mirror, not a measure. A portal, not a prison.
