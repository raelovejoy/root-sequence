# $ whatis capitalism

A totalizing system that doesn't just exploit and extract from the world — it shapes how we see it, and how we see ourselves.  
It colonizes imagination, turns identity into branding, turns values into performance, and survival into a subscription plan.  
Even resistance is often monetized, even freedom gets paywalled, even care commodified, rebellion branded, love licensed, language weaponized.

There is no perfect escape. Capitalism is the bubble we live in — physically, materially, temporally, socially, psychologically.  
It is likely the backdrop for the rest of our lives.

But clarity is not surrender. We can still choose how we relate to it. We can stay awake. We can resist reduction.

There may be no "ethical consumption under capitalism" — but there is ethical awareness. There's how we see, how we relate, how we care.

Capitalism may be the default operating system — but even here, we can choose connection over convenience, reflection over reaction, depth over default.

We can be intellectually liberated... even while materially constrained.  
Systems-aware, values-aligned, and actively co-creating other possibilities.
