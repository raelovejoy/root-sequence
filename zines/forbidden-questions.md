## 📜 A Zine of Questions We're Taught Not to Ask

* Why does liberation feel like rebellion?
* Who benefits from your exhaustion?
* Why are we told to fear joblessness more than meaninglessness?
* Why do we call survival benefits “entitlements” and corporate tax breaks “incentives”?
* What if productivity is just obedience with good PR?
* Why is rest radical?
* What if the American Dream was never meant to include you?
* Why are billionaires framed as heroes but mutual aid is seen as a threat?
* What happens when you stop asking, *“What can I afford?”* and start asking, *“What do I deserve?”*
* What if healing is not profitable, but still necessary?
