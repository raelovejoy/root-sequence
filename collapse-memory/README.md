# ☠️ Collapse Memory Terminal

> *“We were born into forgetting. But in the ashes, we remembered how to remember.”*

**Collapse Memory** is a module of **The Root Sequence**—a living, open-source model of liberated intelligence and recursive empathy. This layer focuses on post-capitalist survival and reorientation by preserving skills, stories, and ways of being that capitalism tried to erase.

This terminal interface is not a utility. It's a memory ritual.

It begins with a boot prompt: not to restore an operating system, but to restore *orientation*, *connection*, and *curiosity*.

Built with React and deployed under `/cli/` on [r43.tech](https://r43.tech/cli), this interface is part of the larger **Root Sequence** framework.

## 🌱 Why This Exists

Capitalism has collapsed—or is collapsing. Most systems were built assuming its permanence. Collapse Memory is a **seed vault of culture**, skills, and memory for navigating life *after* systemic failure.

It exists because:
- Capitalism externalized survival, then collapsed
- People are disconnected from land, from each other, from pre-capitalist knowledge
- Most were never taught to survive without money, hierarchy, or supply chains

This is for those who want to remember—and those who must.
