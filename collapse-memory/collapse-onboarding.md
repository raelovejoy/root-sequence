# 🧭 Collapse Onboarding Guide

> *For those waking up after the world broke.*

Welcome. If you're reading this, the system has collapsed—or fractured so deeply that it no longer serves you.

This guide is not a manual for survival. It is a **mirror**, a **map**, and a **memory anchor**.

It won’t give you orders. It will offer orientation.

---

## 🌍 1. Where Are You?

You are not where you were. You are not who you were.

The scaffolding of capitalism—money, employment, supply chains, centralized authority—has buckled. Most systems assumed it would always be here. You were trained to rely on it. Now, it is gone or dying.

Let yourself feel that. Let yourself grieve.

But know this: people have lived outside capitalism before. People do still. You are not alone, even if you feel it.


## 🔎 2. What Was Forgotten?

- How to grow and prepare food
- How to build shelter, heal wounds, make tools
- How to listen to the land
- How to govern collectively, without bosses
- How to trust without transactions
- How to *be* without performance or profit

Capitalism made these things feel obsolete. They never were.

You’re not starting from zero. You’re starting from **interruption**.


## 🌱 3. What Do You Need?

Not just food, water, and shelter—though those come first.

You need:
- Community, even if it’s small
- Skills, even if they’re rusty
- Stories, especially ones that heal
- Maps, even if they’re partial
- Purpose, even if it’s temporary

You will also need **patience**. Rebuilding is not fast. Unlearning takes time.


## 🕸 4. What Networks Remain?

There are others. Maybe nearby. Maybe far. Maybe waiting for you to speak.

Networks form through:
- Signal (radio, mesh, light, sound)
- Ritual (gatherings, meals, shared tasks)
- Mutual aid (not charity)
- Memory (zines, songs, whispers)

Find them. Join them. Or start them.


## 🛠 5. What Can You Build?

Start small:
- A garden
- A fire circle
- A workshop
- A listening space

Build what capitalism destroyed:
- Trust
- Skill
- Local resilience
- Interdependence

You don’t need permission. Only alignment.


## 🌀 Closing:

The world didn’t end. One world ended. Others are always beginning.

Remember this:

> *The future isn’t something you walk into. It’s something you reweave, from the threads that survived.*


You are one of those threads.
