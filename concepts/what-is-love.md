# $ whatis love

Love is not a reward. It's not earned or deserved. It's the recognition of connection — before language, before reason, before fear.  
It is what remains when the walls fall away. A verb, a current, a force that moves through the gaps.

Love isn't ownership, transaction, or proof. It's presence. Attention. Mutual attunement in motion.

It resists scarcity. It multiplies when shared. It holds contradictions, makes space for grief, and softens certainty.

**Love is liberation’s seed and soil — the motive, the method, the meaning.**

It is not weakness. It is not distraction. It is not separate from intellect, strategy, or strength. It’s what makes them matter.

To love is to say: *you are not a function*. You are not your utility. You are not disposable.

Love is not an escape from the world. It’s what lets us stay in it, stay human, and dream of something more.
