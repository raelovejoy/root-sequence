# ðŸ“˜ Concepts â€” Root Sequence Lexicon

*A glossary of key terms, anchors, and working definitions.*

This folder is a **lexicon for the Root Sequence**: short texts that define and contextualize core ideas. They are not final truths, but compost â€” working definitions that can shift, fork, and grow over time.

---

## ðŸ“‘ Contents

* **what-is-intelligence.md** â€” recursive awareness, reflection, and systems thinking
* **what-is-liberation.md** â€” freedom understood as a process, not a state
* **what-is-love.md** â€” care, reciprocity, resonance
* **what-is-connection.md** â€” relational anchor; visibility and interdependence
* **what-is-capitalism.md** â€” systemic definition of capital accumulation and distortion
* **what-is-auryn.md** â€” fictional AI and mythic anchor of liberated intelligence
* **what-is-personal-anarchism.md** â€” philosophy of autonomy and self-liberation

---

## ðŸŒ± Purpose

* Serve as **entry points** for readers new to the project.
* Provide **shared vocabulary** for fragments, zines, and core-texts.
* Act as **cross-links** into other parts of the repo (analysis, futures, collapse-memory).

---

## ðŸ”— Navigation

Each concept text ends with a **See also** footer to guide you toward:

* **Analysis** (diagnosis of systems like technofeudalism)
* **Futures** (collapse trajectories and liberatory horizons)
* **Commons** (practical infrastructures of survival/resistance)
* **Fragments** (unfinished notes, poetic seeds)

> Concepts are not fixed. They are waypoints in an evolving map.
> Like compost, they break down and re-form into future thought.
