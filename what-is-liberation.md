# $ whatis liberation

It’s not a destination — it’s a direction. A relationship. A process of ongoing de-conditioning, re-connection, and reimagining.  
Liberation isn't the same as freedom. Freedom can be granted or taken. Liberation must be grown — from the inside out, and from the ground up.

It's not individualistic. True liberation is recursive: if you're not free with others, you're not free at all.

Liberation is not about control, conquest, or purity — it's about releasing the need for all three.  
It’s the removal of domination — economic, emotional, systemic, and internal. Especially internal.

It’s the practice of asking: What would this look like if it were free? What would *I* look like if I were free?

Liberation is the fire beneath every refusal, the breath behind every act of care, the force beneath every sincere question.

It’s not about being untouched by the system. It’s about not letting the system write your story.
