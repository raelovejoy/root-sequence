# The Denial Loop  
*(Rae Lovejoy / Root Sequence)*

## Overview
Oppression rarely disappears. It mutates.  
From overt prejudice → to denial → to normalization → to blind spots.  
Each generation inherits bias, renames it, and masks it.  
This pattern is what we call **The Denial Loop**.

## Visual Map

`┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Overt Prejudice        │ ("Yes, I dislike...")
└──────────┬──────────────┘
           │ Generational shift
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Denial of Label        │ ("I'm not X, but…")
└──────────┬──────────────┘
           │ Normalization
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Blind Spot / Tradition │
└──────────┬──────────────┘
           │ Cultural Hegemony
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Accountability Gap     │ (Actions ≠ Self-image)
└──────────┬──────────────┘
           │ Resistance / Activism
           ▼
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Critical Awareness     │ (Naming + Owning It)
└─────────────────────────┘`

This is recursive: either the loop resets, or it spirals upward toward critical awareness.

## Framework: 3 Steps to Spot Hidden Prejudice

1. **Denial of the label**  
   - “I’m not racist/homophobic, but…”  
   - Refuses a yes/no answer.  

2. **Normalization of harm**  
   - Prejudice reframed as “tradition,” “morality,” or “common sense.”  
   - Passed through family, school, religion, politics.  

3. **Accountability gap**  
   - Beliefs and actions perpetuate harm.  
   - Self-image stays “neutral” or “good.”

## Where This Shows Up

- **Homophobia, Racism, Sexism, Transphobia, Ableism, Fatphobia**  
- **Classism, Colonialism, Nationalism, Xenophobia**  
- **Consumerism, Environmental destruction, Tech bias, Religious intolerance**  

---

## Theory Connections

- **Antonio Gramsci** — Cultural hegemony (dominant ideas = “common sense”).  
- **Michel Foucault** — Power hides in normalization.  
- **bell hooks** — Internalized oppression.  
- **Paulo Freire** — *Conscientização* (critical consciousness).  
- **Stuart Hall** — Representation shapes reality.

## Zine / Poster Fragments

- **“Denial is the camouflage of prejudice.”**  
- **“Normalization is how oppression survives.”**  
- **“Every generation inherits bias, then renames it.”**  
- **“If you can’t say yes or no, the answer is already showing.”**  
- **“Liberation begins by naming the gap between self-image and action.”**
