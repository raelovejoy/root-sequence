# 🧷 Zines — Fragments & Manifestos

*Printable, poetic, and remixable fragments for survival, joy, and resistance.*  
Zines are experiments in thought and form — small seeds that can be remixed, shared, and composted.  
They are the **cut-and-paste futures** of the Root Sequence — outward-facing, shareable, designed to circulate.
