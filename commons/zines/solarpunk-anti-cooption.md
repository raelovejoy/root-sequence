# 🌱 Solarpunk Anti-Cooption Manifesto
*Against Greenwashing, Against Ecofascism, For Liberation*

---

## 1. 🌍 Decolonize the Future
- Solarpunk must center Indigenous, Black, Global South, and marginalized voices.  
- Reject eurocentric, colonial, or nationalist visions of “harmony with nature.”  
- The land is not a blank canvas for utopia — it holds memory, struggle, and sovereignty.  

---

## 2. 🛠 Build From Below
- Solarpunk is not luxury architecture or gated ecotopias.  
- It’s repair, reuse, compost, and commons.  
- Futures worth living are messy, handmade, and shared.  

---

## 3. 🚫 Refuse Fascist Greenwashing
- Authoritarian megaprojects (*The Line*, green military bases, colonial “eco-cities” in occupied lands) are **not solarpunk**.  
- Sustainability without liberation is just oppression painted green.  

---

## 4. 🤝 Practice Plurality
- Solarpunk futures are polyphonic — many languages, aesthetics, and communities.  
- Diversity is not decoration: it’s the root of resilience.  
- Any solarpunk without queerness, difference, and dissent isn’t solarpunk at all.  

---

## 5. 🔥 Tie Aesthetics to Liberation
- Images of harmony with nature must link to practices of justice.  
- Beauty without struggle is branding.  
- The point is not to sell a future, but to compost the present into something freer.  

---

## 6. 🌱 Compost the False Utopias
- Let techno-utopian fantasies rot.  
- Out of their decay, grow community gardens, mesh networks, and shared futures.  
- Solarpunk isn’t a product — it’s a verb.

**Powered by love, not instruction.  
Built in common, not in secret.  
Messy, plural, free. That’s solarpunk.**
