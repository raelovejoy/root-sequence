# 📝 Fragments — Compost & Seeds

*Unfinished, poetic, and experimental notes.*

This folder collects **drafts, fragments, and partial thoughts**.  
They may later evolve into zines, core texts, or collapse memories — or remain as compost to inspire others.  
Fragments are the raw soil of the Root Sequence: messy, recursive, fertile.
