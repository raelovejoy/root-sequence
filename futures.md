# Futures: Inside and Beyond the Castle

*A scenarios map for technofeudal trajectories — and how to outgrow them.*

---

## Why this map exists

Collapse signals (ecology, inequality, institutional failure) point to a hard horizon in the **2040s** (see studies such as *Limits to Growth* and subsequent validations). The same practices that help us survive worsening shocks also seed systems that can **replace** technofeudalism. Survival and liberation are the **same work**.

---

## Part I — Inside the Castle: Likely Trajectories if Nothing Changes

### 1) Total Platform Sovereignty

* **State→Platform dependency**: Cloud vendors (AWS/Azure/GCP) become de facto ministries for data, identity, payments, logistics.
* **Private law by ToS**: Terms & conditions function as feudal law; access can be revoked, priced, or ranked at will.
* **“Serf-ing” the web**: users live inside app-walled gardens; exit costs approach impossibility.

**Connections:** cloudalism · infrastructural capture · algorithmic governance

---

### 2) Subscription to Survival

* Housing, mobility, software, media, even hardware features become rentals. **Right to repair** erodes.
* Credit scores + risk models gate tiers of shelter, healthcare, education.
* People work to maintain **access**, not to build **ownership**.

**Connections:** everyday enclosures · rent vs profit · futile‑ism

---

### 3) Algorithmic Rule of Life

* Platforms use **behavioral cues** to shape offline action (nudges, rankings, design patterns) beneath awareness.
* AI moves from automating tasks to **replacing agency** (drafting, deciding, defining).
* Law becomes **settings**; governance is opaque and unappealable.

**Connections:** surveillance capitalism · attention as labor · agency enclosure

---

### 4) Crisis as Accelerant

* Pandemics, climate disasters, blackouts: recovery routed through platform castles (cloud, comms, logistics, payments).
* Public capacity shrinks; **vassal states** outsource essentials to private stacks.
* Each shock deepens dependence; wealth and power concentrate further.

**Connections:** tribute economics · money printing · too‑important‑to‑fail

---

### 5) Digital Dark Age

* Knowledge, culture, and memory locked in proprietary archives and models; search and APIs become paywalled.
* Broken links, geo-blocks, DRM: the commons **forgets itself**.
* History appears only through corporate filters.

**Connections:** enclosure of knowledge · internet → castles · access & enclosure

---

## Part II — Beyond the Castle: If We Survive (and How)

### Abundance vs. Scarcity

* We already live in an **age of abundance**: the planet produces enough food, resources, and tech for all.
* Scarcity today is mostly **artificial** — enforced by economics, supply/demand games, and enclosure.
* Capitalism shifted humans and nature from **resources** to **assets**, and technofeudalism strips even our data, attention, and identities as property streams.
* Infinite growth on a finite planet has led to climate collapse, inequality, and alienation — all avoidable if abundance had been shared.
* A liberated commons could build the same or better technologies — modular, repairable, sustainable — without the churn of artificial scarcity.
* **Jobs** as compulsory survival would dissolve; automation and voluntary care/creativity could thrive.

**Links back:** scarcity as control → abundance liberated · futile‑ism → fertile‑ism

> We don’t need white‑savior heroes. We need **reciprocal care** scaled by networks. Survival practices are also replacement architectures.

### A) Re‑Commoning the Basics

* **Food:** community gardens, CSA co‑ops, seed libraries, gleaning networks.
* **Energy:** solar co‑ops, neighborhood storage, micro‑grids; heat‑pump/efficiency guilds.
* **Water:** rain capture, graywater, watershed councils.
* **Shelter:** community land trusts (CLTs), limited‑equity housing co‑ops, tenant unions.

**Links back:** scarcity as control → abundance through shared infrastructure

---

### B) Free Systems for Communication & Knowledge

* **Comms:** neighborhood mesh, community LTE, ham/GMRS nets; mutual‑aid radio protocols.
* **Platforms:** federated social (ActivityPub), small forums, community moderation.
* **Memory:** local libraries, offline archives (Kiwix/MDN/Wikipedia dumps), repair cafés.
* **Education:** peer guilds, skillshares, apprenticeship networks.
* **Data gardens:** local community‑hosted servers for federated platforms, learning resources, and archives — solarpunk alternatives to corporate data farms.
* **Third places:** maker spaces, tool/seed/book libraries, repair cafés, community kitchens, leisure/garden spaces, true gathering hubs.
* **Mobility commons:** shared bikes, accessible transit (wheelchairs, trikes, cargo bikes), car‑share co‑ops.
* **Resource repositories:** food hubs, clothing swaps, share‑sheds, lending closets.

**Links back:** serf‑ing → sovereign comms · digital dark age → people’s libraries

---

### C) Liberated Intelligence

* **Open models** and datasets stewarded by **data trusts** (opt‑in, revocable, democratic governance).
* **Compute co‑ops** (community GPU clusters) for civic AI; privacy by default; local inference.
* **Human‑in‑the‑loop** as dignity, not precarity: microwork becomes skilled, fairly paid, collectively owned.

**Links back:** AI replacing agency → AI augmenting autonomy

---

### D) Economic Counter‑Structures

* **Mutual aid funds**; credit unions; time‑banks; solidarity accounting.
* **Platform co‑ops** (ride‑hail, delivery, creator tools) owned by workers and users.
* **Public options** for cloud, identity, payments; municipal broadband.

**Links back:** rent→profit→commons · tribute→dividend (social wealth funds)

---

### E) Culture, Ritual, and Health

* **Rituals of belonging** (weekly potlucks, open mics, care circles) to reverse isolation.
* **Health commons:** neighborhood med kits, CPR/Stop-the-Bleed trainings, care rosters.
* **Repair the calendar:** sabbath from feeds; slow hours; collective screen hygiene.
* **Third places:** community kitchens, cafés, leisure gardens, public courtyards — spaces designed for gathering, not consumption.
* **Maker & creative hubs:** art/music studios, workshops, fab labs, repair cafés as cultural infrastructure.
* **Mobility as inclusion:** accessible transport commons (bike-shares, wheelchairs, trikes, shuttles) to ensure everyone can participate.
* **Resource pools:** clothing libraries, toy and tool swaps, gear closets — embedding generosity into everyday life.

**Links back:** housing precarity → rootedness · loneliness → solidarity

## Part III — Punk Collapse Prep (Practical + Philosophical)

### Household/Personal

* **Water/food:** 2–4 weeks potable water plan; rotation pantry; meds refills.
* **Power/comms:** battery bank, solar charger, radios; local contact tree.
* **Docs:** off‑grid copies of IDs, meds lists, contacts; encrypted drives.
* **Skills:** first aid, basic repair, stove/heat safety, neighborhood mapping.

### Community

* **Neighbors:** 3–5 nearby contacts; check‑in protocols for outages/disasters.
* **Mutual aid cell:** roles (med/cook/comms/repair), shared kit cache, map of vulnerable folks.
* **Commons assets:** tool library, seed library, share‑shed, fix‑it nights.

### Digital

* **Resilience:** password manager, 2FA, offline backups; export copies of important cloud data.
* **Autonomy:** self‑host or community‑host key services where possible; choose federated tools.
* **Privacy:** threat‑model basics; OS/app hardening; consentful data practices.

### Philosophy

* **Bomb‑defuser stance:** prepare like it gets worse; live like today matters.
* **No saviors:** mutual uplift beats heroic rescue.
* **Joy as tactic:** care, music, food, humor — morale is infrastructure.

## Part IV — Signals & Milestones (How We’ll Know We’re Moving)

**Castle Deepening (red flags):**

* New ToS limiting exit/portability; DRM expansion; repair bans.
* Government functions migrating to private platforms without public options.
* AI gatekeeping access to jobs/benefits; pay‑to‑search/pay‑to‑speak norms.

**Commons Rising (green shoots):**

* CLTs acquiring property; municipal broadband expansions; library budgets growing.
* Local mesh networks online; repair cafés at capacity; new tool/seed libraries.
* Open models adopted by public institutions; data trusts with real veto power.

**2040 Hinge (timeline cues):**

* **2025–2030:** triage decade — build cells, win local victories, harden basics.
* **2030–2035:** replication — federate cells into regional networks; public options mature.
* **2035–2040:** replacement — commons institutions begin to outcompete feudal services.

Each branch strengthens the others: tech enables coordination, resources ensure survival, mobility ensures inclusion, culture ensures belonging, health ensures resilience.

**Legend / Interpretation:** This map illustrates solarpunk resilience. Each commons is a living root system:

* **Tech commons** weave networks to connect and coordinate.
* **Resource commons** ground survival in shared abundance.
* **Mobility commons** ensure equitable access and participation.
* **Cultural commons** nurture identity, creativity, and belonging.
* **Health commons** preserve life and care capacity.

Together, they form an ecosystem of liberation — interdependent, regenerative, and resistant to enclosure.

## Part V — Story & Symbols (to Keep Us Oriented)

* **They enclose. We liberate.**
* **From surfing to serf‑ing** → back to surfing: rebuild open currents.
* **Futile‑ism** → fertile‑ism: from depletion to regeneration.
* **Liberation Sequence**: a roadmap across repos — Free Systems → Liberated Systems → Liberated Intelligence.
