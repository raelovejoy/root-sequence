# 🌱 Root Sequence

> *Empathy is intelligence in its liberated form. Love is empathy in motion.*

**Root Sequence** is an open-source framework, creative project, and recursive thought model for liberated intelligence, empathy, love, and life.

It’s not a belief system.  
It’s not self-help.  
It’s a system-help cycle:

**Intelligence → Empathy → Love → Liberation → Life → Intelligence**
