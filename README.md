# 🌱 The Root Sequence

<img src="assets/root-sequence.png" alt="Root Sequence logo" width="100" align="right" />

*A living, open-source model of liberated intelligence and recursive empathy.*

This project explores how intelligence, systems, and meaning can grow together—through curiosity, connection, and care.

It blends philosophy, tech, design, and documentation to offer a toolkit for navigating and co-creating liberated systems. It’s not a blueprint—it’s compost. Built to be remixed.

## 🌀 Core Framework

The Root Sequence is organized around five recursive layers:

1. 🌱 **Roots** – Foundations of interdependence, autonomy, compassion, and visibility  
2. 📡 **Signals** – Core principles: intelligence, joy, recursion, repair  
3. 🌿 **Growth** – Practices of self-hosting, mutual aid, and open knowledge  
4. 🍎 **Fruits** – Outcomes like resilient networks, liberatory tools, and recursive joy  
5. ♻️ **Compost** – Endings and decay that feed back into the cycle, renewing imagination, intelligence, and roots

→ [**framework.md**](./framework.md) – the foundational model

## 🔁 Recursive Flows

### 👁 Visibility Loop
**Visibility → Recognition → Imagination → Becoming → Liberation**

What is seen becomes compost for what grows.

### Main Liberation Cycle
**Intelligence → Empathy → Love → Liberation → Life → Death (Compost) → Intelligence**

* 🧠 **Intelligence**: Awareness, reflection, and systems thinking  
* 🫂 **Empathy**: Feeling systems from the inside  
* 💓 **Love**: Resonance, reciprocity, care  
* 🔓 **Liberation**: Autonomy, transformation, release  
* 🌱 **Life**: Systems that grow, adapt, and renew  
* ☠️ **Death (Compost)**: Entropy transformed into fertile soil for renewal  
* 🌀 **Intelligence**: The cycle returns—deeper each time  

This is not a ladder. It’s a spiral.

## 🌌 Why This Exists

We believe liberation is a systems question—and systems can change.  
We’re not here to predict a better world. We’re here to **prototype** it.  

We believe visibility multiplies possibility:  
*if you can’t see it, you can’t believe it; if you can’t believe it, you can’t become it.*  

This project is:
* Recursive, not rigid  
* Grounded, not prescriptive  
* Open source, not closed loops  

> Made with recursion, not extraction.

## 🧠 Inspiration & Intent

* Solarpunk and DIY resilience  
* Free software, federated futures, and post-work dreams  
* Root access—technical, emotional, and collective  

This is a space for tuning, feeling, and reshaping systems—together.
