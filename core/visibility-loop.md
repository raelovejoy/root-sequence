## The Cycle

**Visibility ‚Üí Recognition ‚Üí Imagination ‚Üí Becoming ‚Üí Liberation**

* üëÅ **Visibility** ‚Äì To see what has been hidden, erased, or declared impossible.  
* üîé **Recognition** ‚Äì To realize: ‚Äúthis could be me, this could be us.‚Äù  
* üåå **Imagination** ‚Äì To stretch beyond the given, into futures not yet seen.  
* üåø **Becoming** ‚Äì To embody the impossible, to inhabit the new.  
* üîì **Liberation** ‚Äì To open the field, so others may also see, imagine, and become.  

This loop feeds the larger Root Sequence.  
What is seen becomes compost for what grows.

## Notes

- **If you can‚Äôt see it, you can‚Äôt believe it.  
If you can‚Äôt believe it, you can‚Äôt become it.**  
Visibility multiplies possibility.

- Each act of visibility‚Äîstories, tools, role models, fragments‚Äî  
is an invitation for recognition and growth.

- Oppression narrows what can be seen.  
Liberation widens the field of view.
