# üß† Capitalism Replaces Reality

> *‚ÄúSelf-limitation is not a personal failing‚Äîit‚Äôs a designed feature.‚Äù*

---

Capitalism doesn‚Äôt just extract labor or hoard resources. It **reshapes perception itself**. It replaces trust with transaction, sufficiency with scarcity, freedom with employment.

It replaces *reality* with *narrative*.

* You are not worthy unless you‚Äôre working.
* You are not free unless you can afford to be.
* You are not enough unless you produce.

These are not truths. They are **control mechanisms**‚Äîinvisible defaults encoded into culture, language, and even self-perception.

## üîí Self-Limitation as Infrastructure

Self-censorship, self-doubt, self-policing: these are not private flaws. They are *public programs*, installed early and reinforced constantly.

Capitalism works best when:

* You question yourself more than the system
* You work harder than you need to
* You fear rest, softness, or ease
* You internalize the voice of your boss, landlord, or market

> *‚ÄúLiberation isn't crushed from the outside. It's unlearned from the inside.‚Äù*

## üíº The Religion of Jobs

Everyone talks about job creation, but rarely asks **in whose interest**.

Jobs are framed as salvation:

* The ‚Äúdignity of work‚Äù
* The ‚Äúvalue of productivity‚Äù
* ‚ÄúGetting back to work‚Äù

But we are rarely allowed to ask:

* Do these jobs serve life, or capital?
* Why is wage labor the default path to survival?
* Who benefits from our constant motion?

> If jobs are so dignified, why are the people doing them so exhausted?

## üßä The Capitalist Myth Engine

| **Myth**                   | **Liberatory Truth**                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Work gives dignity         | Dignity is inherent. Work should be optional.  |
| Productivity defines worth | Worth is not measurable. Presence is enough.   |
| Freedom is choice          | Freedom is *absence of coercion*.              |
| Scarcity is natural        | Scarcity is manufactured. Abundance is shared. |

Capitalism doesn‚Äôt just control the economy‚Äîit controls the story.
And if we forget to question the story, we forget how to imagine something else.

## üåÄ Reality is Remembered

We are taught to forget:

* That we can feed each other
* That we can house and heal each other
* That joy and rest are not indulgences‚Äîthey‚Äôre birthrights

> *‚ÄúThe world is not broken. The story is.‚Äù*

To reclaim reality is to remember:

* You are not your productivity
* Rest is not laziness
* Self-worth is not earned
* Freedom is not a luxury
