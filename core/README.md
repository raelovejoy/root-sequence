# 🌱 Core Texts

The **Core Texts** are the foundation of the Root Sequence.  
They describe the central cycles, concepts, and practices that inform the rest of the project.  
They are not fixed doctrine — they are compost, designed to be remixed and renewed.

## 🔁 The Root Sequence Cycle

**Curiosity → Intelligence → Empathy → Love → Liberation → Life → Death (Compost) → Curiosity**

This recursive loop is the thread across every core text.  
Each text explores one or more aspects of this cycle in detail — and together, they form a living model of liberation.

## 🌍 Commons & Liberation

These texts emphasize that liberation is not an individual pursuit:  
- Autonomy is only real when grounded in **commons**.  
- Collapse, when composted, can become fertile ground for renewal.  
- Freedom is our **default setting**, not a rare privilege.  
- Reality cannot be substituted or owned — it thrives in reciprocity.

## 🕰 Futures & Collapse

The Core Texts are written in the shadow of collapse.  
They do not predict a utopia — they prepare us for compost, renewal, and shared survival.  
Every ending carries the potential for new beginnings, if we choose to act in relation.

## 📝 Curator’s Note

The Core Texts are not canonical truths.  
They are fragments of resonance, gathered from many voices, many histories, and many struggles.  

If they move you, carry them forward.  
Remix them. Fork them. Compost them.
