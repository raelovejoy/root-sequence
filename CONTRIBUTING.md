# 🤝 Contributing to Root Sequence

Welcome! This project is open-source, non-hierarchical, and non-coercive by design.  
It exists to **resonate**, not dominate—and you are invited to participate however feels true.

- 👐 **Open source**: All contributions remain free to remix under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).
