# 🌱 The Autonomy & Self-Determination Manifesto

> *“You are not a product. You are not a brand. You are not a profile. You are a pattern in motion—a system, not a simulation.”*

## I. Premise

We live in a world of defaults—settings, roles, identities, behaviors—pre-selected by opaque systems designed to maximize profit, extract compliance, and minimize deviation.

Autonomy is not merely the ability to *choose* between options—but the capacity to *generate* your own.  
Self-determination is not just freedom from constraint—but the co-creation of liberating systems, together.

This is a call to reclaim the **uncommodified**, **unautomated**, and **unpredictable**.

## II. What Is Being Replaced?

Capitalism replaces:

- 🌿 **Living systems** with scalable products  
- 🧠 **Thinking** with algorithmic suggestion  
- ❤️ **Connection** with monetized simulation  
- 🎨 **Expression** with marketable identity  
- 🌀 **Process** with output  
- 🌍 **World-building** with world-buying  

Every replacement narrows the field of experience, steering us toward pre-quantified lives.

## III. What We Choose Instead

We choose to:

- 🛠️ **Build tools that amplify agency**, not extract value  
- 🔍 **Question defaults**, even the subtle ones (like “normal”)  
- 🔁 **Recursively reconfigure ourselves and our systems**  
- 🤝 **Co-create meaning** rather than consume narratives  
- 🌱 **Practice autonomy in relation**—because freedom is interdependence

## IV. Patterns of Liberation (Call to Action)

1. **Slow Down Defaults**  
   - Ask: Who benefits from this setting, this design, this behavior?  
   - Disable “autoplay”—in media, in thought, in routine.

2. **Liberate Your Inputs**  
   - Curate your data stream. Abandon the feed.  
   - Seek peers, not influencers.

3. **Design from First Principles**  
   - For every tool or system, ask: Could I build or remix this myself?  
   - Fork the world. Version control your values.

4. **Refuse Optimization as Identity**  
   - You are not a KPI.  
   - Celebrate inefficiency, messiness, and contradiction.

5. **Make Space for Others to Choose**  
   - Respect divergence. Expect difference.  
   - Decentralize not just tech, but care.

## V. This Is Not a Final Version

This manifesto is open-source. It will change.  
Version yourself freely.  
Autonomy doesn’t mean isolation—it means co-creating a world worth choosing.

## 🌀 Footnote: From Collapse to Compost

If capitalism is a system of simulation and substitution, let this be a system of **resonance** and **regeneration**.

> *“What do we choose now?”*
