# Billionaires as Digital Lords


## From Innovators to Rentiers
The myth of the billionaire entrepreneur obscures the reality: today’s billionaires are feudal lords, extracting rents rather than competing.


- Amazon skims transactions instead of making goods.
- Apple taxes apps instead of fostering open markets.
- Meta monetizes culture it does not produce.


## Feeding, Not Competing
Like the Machines of *The Matrix*, billionaires no longer innovate — they feed. They:
- Buy rivals.
- Enclose ecosystems.
- Use states to entrench power.


## Velocity and Hoarding
Low interest rates inflate billionaire assets. High rates hurt everyone else. In either case, wealth pools upward, circulation stalls.


## Conclusion
Billionaires embody technofeudalism. They are not captains of industry but lords of enclosure, feeding on human labor, creativity, and attention.
