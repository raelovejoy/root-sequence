# ☁️ Cloudalism — The Cloud as Feudal Land

The **cloud** is often imagined as immaterial — but it is physical infrastructure: servers, cables, and control centers.  
**Cloudalism** reframes it as a **new kind of land** — privately owned, enclosed, and rented back to its users.

## 🔎 Diagnosis

- **Platform landlords** — Amazon, Microsoft, Google as cloud barons.  
- **Rents not ownership** — users lease storage, apps, and compute power.  
- **Opacity** — the cloud hides its material and political costs.  
- **Lock-in** — dependency through data gravity and proprietary ecosystems.
