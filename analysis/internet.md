# 🌐 Internet — From Open to Enclosed

The internet began as a **commons of possibility** — decentralized, open, and experimental.  
Over time, it has been **enclosed into walled gardens**: platforms, app stores, and surveillance economies.

## 🔎 Diagnosis

- **Early promise** — protocols, mailing lists, peer-to-peer sharing.  
- **Enclosure** — platforms capture flows of attention and data.  
- **Surveillance capitalism** — monetization of every click, like, and interaction.  
- **Algorithmic control** — feeds replace browsing, visibility determined by opaque systems.
