# Technofeudalism


## From Capitalism to Digital Feudalism
- **Capitalism:** wealth through markets, profit from competition.
- **Technofeudalism:** wealth through rents, profit from enclosing platforms and data.


Like feudal lords owned land, platform billionaires own **digital territory** — clouds, app stores, marketplaces — and extract tolls from all who pass.


## Key Traits
- **Rent Extraction:** Apple’s App Store fees, Amazon Marketplace cuts, cloud lock-in.
- **Enclosure of Commons:** knowledge, code, creativity absorbed into private systems.
- **Decline of Velocity:** money no longer circulates; it pools in fiefdoms.
- **Serfs and Vassals:** gig workers, creators, even AI models reduced to servants.


## Consequences
- Traditional monetary tools (interest rates, QE) lose traction; circulation is blocked.
- Governments become vassals, subsidizing lords deemed “too big to fail.”
- Innovation slows; power consolidates.


## Liberation?
The historic answer to feudalism was **the commons**. Our task is the same: reclaim shared intelligence, open networks, cooperative infrastructures. Liberation means building the digital commons in defiance of the lords.
