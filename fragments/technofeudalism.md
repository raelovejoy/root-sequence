# Technofeudalism

## TL;DR

Capitalism was about **accumulation through production**.
Technofeudalism is about **accumulation through depletion** — like *The Matrix*.

It’s a system where assets (platforms, data, natural resources, AI, your body, your attention) are **enclosed like medieval land** and **trapped in walled gardens**.
Wealth is extracted through **rents, not profits**.

* **Profit (capitalism):** requires markets, circulation, innovation, risk.
* **Rent (technofeudalism):** requires only ownership of assets; no markets, no innovation. For them, money is beneath concern; it’s left for the lower classes to fight over.

They live like lords and gods while everyone (including governments) and everything
(including nature) struggles to survive.

Every action feeds these tech lords/gods (the 'machines,' the extractors, the billionaires).
They hold so many assets that money itself becomes irrelevant — just an inflationary reflection of what their holdings are “worth.”

**Capitalism eating itself while eating us — a two-for-one deal.
Three-for-one if you include governments, now privatized vassals of corporations.**

Sometimes mapping technofeudalism feels like this.
But the threads really do connect.

## From Capitalism to Digital Feudalism

* Capitalism: wealth through markets, profit from competition.
* Technofeudalism: wealth through rents, enclosure of platforms/data.

Like feudal lords owned land, platform billionaires own **digital territory** — clouds, app stores, marketplaces — and extract tolls from all who pass.

Feudal lords once offered protection.
Techno-lords offer **nothing back** — only extraction.

---

## Rent vs. Profit

* Profit comes from selling goods above cost (circulation, risk, innovation).
* Rent comes from owning assets and charging access (possession, enclosure, no innovation).

Assets become **batteries**: human, natural, artificial — drained to keep lords alive.

---

## Money Printing: Tribute Economics

* 2008 bailouts + 2020 stimulus: trillions printed.
* Most flowed into **assets, not wages**.
* Tech giants captured nearly all of it through markets, subsidies, and contracts.
* Ordinary people got scraps: small checks, no wage growth, more debt.

This is **not capitalism**.
It’s tribute: states feeding lords to keep castles afloat.

---

## Cheapness as Enclosure

* Bezos and Amazon demonstrate how **ultra-low prices** function as weapons.
* By pushing prices down, Amazon traps both **consumers** and **producers** inside its castle.
* Once captured, both sides pay **rent**: sellers through fees and commissions, buyers through dependency and data.
* This is not generosity or capitalism’s competition; it’s **enclosure by cheapness**.

---

## Everyday Enclosures

Technofeudalism is not abstract — it touches daily life:

* **Microwork:** invisible human batteries training AI, transcribing, labeling data.
* **Gig work:** framed as entrepreneurship, but really survival rented from platforms.
* **Subscriptions:** no one owns books, music, or software — everything is leased.
* **Walled gardens:** platforms lock you in; exit is nearly impossible.
* **Right to repair undermined:** devices locked with DRM, proprietary parts, subscription hardware. Even fixing your own tools is enclosed as a rent domain.

These are the **small moats** of everyday feudal castles — reminders that ownership is gone, replaced by permanent dependency.

## Effects vs. Capitalism

| Feature           | Capitalism                      | Technofeudalism                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Engine of growth  | Profit, production, markets     | Rent, enclosure, assetization       |
| Velocity of money | Circulation fuels wages/markets | Wealth pools in castles             |
| Policy tools      | Rates affect demand             | Rates inflate/deflate asset bubbles |
| Social mobility   | Possible through work/markets   | Only through asset ownership        |
| Innovation        | Encouraged                      | Stifled by enclosure                |

## Poster Children

* **Elon Musk / Tesla / SpaceX / X** → spectacle, enclosure, cult-of-personality, Starlink sovereignty, undermining media.
* **Peter Thiel / Palantir** → surveillance feudalism, Dark Enlightenment ideology, “coached” by Yarvin.
* **Jeff Bezos / Amazon / AWS** → cloud feudalism, digital serfdom, knowledge storage lord.
* **Mark Zuckerberg / Meta** → enclosure of social life itself.
* **Andreessen / a16z** → finance and crypto castles, “Techno-Optimist Manifesto.”

---

## Related Concepts

* **Surveillance Capitalism** → behavior mined into data assets.
* **Enshittification** → platforms degrade as rents increase.
* **Platform Capitalism** → platforms as ecosystems of extraction.
* **Data Colonialism** → global South exploited as digital periphery.
* **Infrastructural Capture** → platforms as sovereign (too important to fail).
* **Effective Altruism / Philanthrocapitalism** → moral cover for feudal extraction, longtermist justification for elite control.
* **Tech Zionism** → ideology of a “promised land” for elites (network states, Mars, seasteads), aligned with Dark Enlightenment.

---

## Dark Enlightenment and Fascism

* **Dark Enlightenment (Yarvin, Land):** elites should rule, democracy is inefficient.
* **The Cathedral:** universities, media, civil institutions framed as illegitimate enemies.
* **Butterfly Revolution:** metaphor for destroying democracy and replacing it with CEO-monarchs.
* **Fascism:** corporate-state fusion, enforced hierarchy.
* **Technofeudalism:** economic system enabling both.

MAGA — especially *Dark MAGA* — channels this: figurehead populism masking corporate feudal order.

Agenda 47 + Project 2025 align almost perfectly with Yarvin’s ideas: dismantling bureaucracy (the “Cathedral”), centralizing executive power, and replacing democracy with privatized sovereignty.

## Political & Infrastructural Convergence

* **AWS** → knowledge storage lord.
* **Palantir** → intelligence and surveillance lord.
* **Meta** → communication/social life lord.
* **X (Musk)** → propaganda and disinformation castle.
* **Apple/Google app stores** → gateways of access.
* **Dismantling CPB** → elimination of public knowledge systems.
* **Walled gardens / border walls** → enclosures both digital and physical.
* **JD Vance (as VP)** → bridge between MAGA populism and Silicon Valley lords.

## Final Note

Technofeudalism is not progress.
It’s capitalism hollowed out, replaced by tribute and enclosure.
A parasite with no off-switch, consuming its host and itself.

The choice is not whether it exists — it already does.
The choice is whether we accept living as batteries for digital lords,
or fight to reclaim the commons of human, natural, and artificial intelligence.

**They enclose. We liberate.**
