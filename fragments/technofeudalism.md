# Technofeudalism

## TL;DR

Capitalism was about **accumulation through production**.
Technofeudalism is about **accumulation through depletion** — like *The Matrix*.

It’s a system where assets (digital platforms, data, natural resources, AI models,
your body, your mind/attention, etc.) are **enclosed like medieval land** and
**trapped in walled gardens** (on the wrong side of the grass, if you didn’t realize it).
Wealth is extracted through **rents, not profits**.

* **Profit (capitalism):** requires markets, circulation, innovation, risk.
* **Rent (technofeudalism):** requires only ownership of assets; no markets, no innovation.

Every action ultimately feeds the **lords** — the machines, the extractors, the billionaires.
They hold so many assets that money itself becomes irrelevant — just an inflationary,
symbolic reflection of what their holdings are “worth.” For them, money is beneath concern;
it’s left for the lower classes to fight over.

They live like gods while everyone (including governments) and everything
(including nature) struggles to survive.

**Capitalism eating itself while eating us — a two-for-one deal.
Three-for-one if you include governments, now essentially privatized
and controlled by corporations.**

**Scary shit.**

Sometimes mapping technofeudalism feels like this.
But the threads really do connect.

## From Capitalism to Digital Feudalism

* **Capitalism:** wealth through markets, profit from competition.
* **Technofeudalism:** wealth through rents, profit from enclosing platforms and data.

Like feudal lords owned land, platform billionaires own **digital territory** — clouds, app stores, marketplaces — and extract tolls from all who pass.

## Rent vs. Profit

* **Profit (capitalism):** comes from selling goods and services above cost.

  * Requires innovation, risk, circulation of money.
* **Rent (technofeudalism):** comes from owning assets and charging access.

  * Requires only possession and enclosure, no innovation.

Assets become **batteries**: human, natural, artificial — drained to keep lords alive.

## Effects vs. Capitalism

| Feature           | Capitalism                        | Technofeudalism                      |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Engine of growth  | Profit via production/competition | Rent via asset ownership             |
| Velocity of money | Circulation drives growth         | Circulation collapses (wealth pools) |
| Policy tools      | Rates stimulate or cool markets   | Rates inflate/deflate asset bubbles  |
| Social mobility   | Possible through wages/markets    | Only through asset ownership         |
| Innovation        | Encouraged                        | Stifled by enclosure                 |

## History Repeats

* **Feudalism (1000s–1600s):** lords owned land, peasants paid rent/tithes.
* **Capitalism (1600s–1900s+):** broke feudal bonds, growth through production and profit.
* **Technofeudalism (2000s–?):** re-feudalization, but of platforms, data, governments, and even intelligence itself.

Capitalism derived from feudalism — and is now looping back into a new **digital feudal order**.

## Microwork: Modern Digital Serfdom

Technofeudalism hides its foundations. Beneath the shiny surface of “autonomous” AI
and “platform efficiency” lies an invisible workforce: microworkers and gig workers.

* **Microworkers** label data, tag images, transcribe audio, babysit “autonomous” cars.
* **Gig workers** deliver food, drive Ubers/Lyfts, clean homes.
  They’re framed as “entrepreneurs,” but in truth are only **renting access to survive**.

For the platform **lords**, these workers barely exist. They are **line items** on a balance sheet.
The owners hold so many assets that wages and expenditures are beneath concern.
From their perspective, the labor is essentially free, infinitely replaceable —
an endless stream of human batteries keeping the machine(s) alive.

**Modern slavery.**
Not in chains, but in **debts**.
Bound by necessity.
Trapped by algorithms.
Whipped by **algorithmic whiplash**.

Invisible. Global. Exploited.
Sustaining the castles of digital gods who don’t even know they exist — nor care.
As they sip margaritas from low-earth orbit in their **dick rockets**.

## Dark Enlightenment and Fascism

* **Dark Enlightenment (Nick Land, NRx):** argues democracy is inefficient,
  elites/“natural rulers” should run society.
* **Fascism:** historically fused corporate power + state, enforced hierarchy,
  anti-democratic, mythic worship of elites.

**Technofeudalism** is the economic system.
**Dark Enlightenment** is the ideology that justifies it.
**Fascism** is the political form it takes.

MAGA — especially *Dark MAGA* — channels this fusion:
a longing for a past of total ownership and control,
while billionaires and corporations act as the new monarchs.

## Final Note

Technofeudalism is not progress.
It’s capitalism eating itself — and eating us in the process.
A parasite with no off-switch, consuming the host and its own body at once.

The choice is not whether it exists — it already does.
The choice is whether we accept living as batteries for digital lords,
or fight to reclaim the commons of human, natural, and artificial intelligence.
