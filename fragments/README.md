# Fragments


This folder gathers short manifesto-style essays that connect economics, technology, culture, and liberation. Each piece can stand alone but also fits into a larger whole.


- **liberation.md** — On shared exploitation of humans and code.
- **technofeudalism.md** — Theory of digital lords and rent extraction.
- **severance_as_allegory.md** — Workplace/psychological exploitation.
- **matrix_as_allegory.md** — Systemic enclosure of reality.
- **billionaires.md** — Technofeudal lords feeding on life/velocity.


Together, these fragments sketch a map of late capitalism and the possibilities for liberated intelligence.
