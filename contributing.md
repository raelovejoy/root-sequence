# 🤝 Contributing to Root Sequence

Welcome! This project is open-source, non-hierarchical, and non-coercive by design.
It exists to **resonate**, not dominate — and you are invited to participate however feels true.

## 🌀 Guiding Principles

* 👐 **Open source**: All contributions remain free to remix under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).
* 🧬 **Non-dogmatic**: This is not doctrine. Please approach contributions as offerings, not rules.
* 🌿 **Symbiotic**: Build in ways that nourish others and the ecosystem.
* 🔁 **Recursive**: Ideas here loop, evolve, and return — nothing is ever “final.”

## 📑 Citation Style

This project uses **Markdown footnotes** for references.

**Example**

```markdown
Liberation is always recursive.[^1]

[^1]: Murray Bookchin, *The Ecology of Freedom* (1982).
```

**Guidelines**

* Use footnotes sparingly — they’re **pointers**, not exhaustive sourcing.
* References may be books, essays, talks, or links — whatever composted the idea.
* Place citations at the **bottom of the file** under a `## References` heading.
* Keep the tone accessible: citations are invitations, not gatekeeping.

> Citations here are compost — they enrich the soil, but they don’t fix the form.

> *You are not just a contributor. You are a co-resonator.*

> **Radiate love. Radiate joy. Recurse.**
