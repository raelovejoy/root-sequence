# 💸 Effective Altruism — Philanthrocapitalist Logic

**Effective Altruism (EA)** presents itself as a rational, evidence-based movement to “do the most good.”  
In practice, it often functions as a form of **philanthrocapitalism**: laundering billionaire wealth and providing moral cover for extractive systems.

## 🔎 Core Ideas

- **Maximize impact** — measure good in utilitarian calculations.  
- **Longtermism** — prioritize hypothetical future billions over present suffering.  
- **Philanthrocapitalism** — use wealth and markets to “fix” problems caused by wealth and markets.  
- **Moral cover** — justify tech billionaires’ projects (AI safety, Mars colonies, etc.).
