# ⚠️ Fascism — Systems of Hierarchy and Control

Fascism is not just an ideology.  
It is a **pattern of control**: the fusion of authoritarian power, myth, and violence into a system that thrives on crisis.

## 🔎 What Is Fascism?

At its core, fascism is defined by:

- **Hierarchy as natural** — belief that some must rule while others must obey.  
- **Unity through exclusion** — identity built by casting out an “other.”  
- **Myth over truth** — stories and symbols override reality.  
- **Mass mobilization** — people organized into spectacle, often against enemies.  
- **Authoritarian fusion** — state, corporations, and culture woven together to enforce order.  

Fascism is not confined to the 20th century. It **mutates and re-emerges**, adapting to new technologies and crises.

## 🧠 The Psychology of Fascism

- **Fear & resentment** — fascism feeds on economic and cultural anxieties.  
- **Projection** — blaming others for systemic failures (“enemies within” or “outsiders”).  
- **Authoritarian personality** — attraction to strong leaders who promise order.  
- **Nostalgia politics** — glorifying a mythic past that never truly existed.

## 🎨 Aesthetics of Fascism

Fascism operates through **images and affects** as much as through laws and violence.  
It doesn’t only control people’s bodies — it **shapes what feels beautiful, safe, or natural.**

- **Minimalist futurism** — sterile design masking exclusionary politics.  
- **AI-generated art** — sanitized propaganda that feels neutral but erases context.  
- **Ecofascist visions** — nature and purity twisted into nationalist or colonial projects.  
- **Techno-utopian spectacles** — megaprojects like Saudi Arabia’s *The Line* marketed as clean futures but built on displacement and control.  
- **Nostalgia loops** — uniforms, symbols, and styles that mythologize “tradition.”

## ⚙️ Tactics of Fascism

Fascism spreads not only through ideology but through **tactics**:

- **Enclosure of commons** — privatizing and enclosing public life.  
- **Disinformation & mythmaking** — destabilizing truth to control perception.  
- **Scapegoating** — blaming marginalized groups for systemic problems.  
- **Militarization** — valorizing violence as purification.  
- **Crisis exploitation** — using collapse (economic, ecological, cultural) as justification for authoritarianism.

## 🌐 Fascism and Other Systems

Fascism rarely stands alone — it fuses with other forms of power:

- **Technofeudalism** → fascism as cultural arm of enclosure. Platforms normalize hierarchy and control visibility.  
  → See [technofeudalism.md](../analysis/technofeudalism.md)  

- **Dark Enlightenment** → accelerationist thinkers provide philosophical cover for hierarchy, recasting fascism in libertarian or techno-utopian terms.  
  → See [dark_enlightenment.md](dark_enlightenment.md)  

- **Cloudalism & Platform Power** → fascist content thrives in algorithmic systems that privilege engagement and outrage.  
  → See [cloudalism.md](../analysis/cloudalism.md)  

- **Collapse & Ecofascism** → climate crisis weaponized to justify authoritarian “solutions” (strong borders, demographic control).  
  → See [collapse-memory](../futures/collapse-memory/README.md)

## 🌱 Root Sequence Perspective

Fascism thrives on enclosure, purity, and control.  
The Root Sequence proposes alternatives rooted in:

- **Plurality** — many kinds of lives, not one “ideal.”  
- **Decolonization** — dismantling myths of purity and supremacy.  
- **Compost** — seeing collapse and endings as renewal, not justification for control.  
- **Liberation** — autonomy, empathy, repair, and play as antidotes to authoritarianism.  

> *Fascism feeds on fear. Liberation composts fear into curiosity, care, and joy.*
