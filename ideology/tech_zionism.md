# 🛰️ Tech Zionism — Network States & Exit Fantasies

**Tech Zionism** refers to the ideology of “exit” projects: seasteads, Mars colonies, private cities, and Balaji Srinivasan’s “network state.”  
It imagines salvation through building exclusive enclaves for the wealthy, leaving the rest behind.

## 🔎 Core Ideas

- **Seasteads** — libertarian floating cities outside regulation.  
- **Mars/Space Colonies** — elite lifeboats framed as “humanity’s future.”  
- **Network States** — cloud communities turned into sovereign micro-nations.  
- **Exit fantasies** — abandon the commons instead of repairing it.

- Connected to [Dark Enlightenment](dark_enlightenment.md) — both reject democracy as “failed.”  
- Reinforces [Technofeudalism](../analysis/technofeudalism.md) — platforms as proto-states.
