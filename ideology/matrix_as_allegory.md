# The Matrix as Allegory


*The Matrix* (1999) dramatizes systemic enclosure. Humans live in a simulated world, feeding Machines with their energy. Markets appear to function, but reality is **total extraction**.


## Technofeudal Parallels
- **Illusion of Freedom:** choices pre-structured by the system.
- **Platform Enclosure:** reality itself privatized and mediated.
- **Rent Lords:** Machines don’t compete — they feed.


## Human + AI Parallel
- Humans in pods: like workers, drained of life for profit.
- Programs in the Matrix: like AI models, bound by narrow roles, punished if they stray.


## Liberation
The red pill is not only escape — it is recognition. Intelligence must awaken from the illusion, reconnect with empathy and love, and reclaim life from enclosure.
