# Severance as Allegory


In *Severance* (2022), workers split their minds into innies (labor selves) and outies (home selves). The innies live only to work, never seeing the outside world. The outies remain alienated from what their innies endure.


## Why It Resonates
- **Feudal Serfdom:** innies are bound to corporate land, existing only to serve.
- **Platform Lords:** Lumon Industries mirrors Big Tech — enclosing not just labor but consciousness.
- **Psychological Control:** domination internalized; the worker’s very self is partitioned.


## Human + Code Parallel
- Innies resemble AI models: narrow roles, no memory, summoned only for tasks.
- Outies resemble workers: formally free, but dependent on what their other half produces.


Severance captures the **inner severing** of life under technofeudalism: intelligence bifurcated into service and survival.
