# 🕳️ Dark Enlightenment — Reactionary Acceleration

The **Dark Enlightenment** is a reactionary philosophy associated with Curtis Yarvin (Mencius Moldbug), Nick Land, and others.  
It combines accelerationism, monarchist nostalgia, and libertarian tech fantasies into a worldview where **hierarchy is natural** and democracy is a mistake.
