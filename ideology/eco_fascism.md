# 🌲 Ecofascism — Green Masks for Authoritarian Control

**Ecofascism** takes the aesthetics and urgency of ecological collapse and twists them into exclusionary, authoritarian responses.  
It is the dark shadow of solarpunk — purity, harmony, and “nature” weaponized as justification for control.

## 🔎 Core Ideas

- **Purity politics** — land and people must be “cleansed.”  
- **Population control** — scarcity framed as requiring authoritarian solutions.  
- **Borders as ecology** — “protecting nature” through exclusion and violence.  
- **Greenwashing fascism** — selling authoritarianism as environmental necessity.
