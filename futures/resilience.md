# 🛠 Resilience — Practices of Survival and Renewal

Resilience is the capacity of communities and systems to **endure crisis and regenerate**.  
It is not just survival — it is the art of composting collapse into life.

## 🔎 Practices

- **Food sovereignty** — community gardens, seed banks, plant knowledge.  
- **Energy autonomy** — solar co-ops, microgrids, off-grid repairs.  
- **Skill commons** — mutual teaching of repair, care, and making.  
- **Mesh & comms** — community radios, mesh networks, offline tools.  
- **Collapse drills** — practicing futures together before they arrive.
