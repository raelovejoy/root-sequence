# 🕯️ Capitalist Myths (Collapse Memory Fragment)

> *“In the Before, they worshipped jobs. They called it dignity. They forgot what it meant to live.”*

## 🧠 What We Were Told

These were the myths we were taught to believe:

* Work gives your life value
* The market knows what is best
* You are lazy unless exhausted
* Ownership is freedom
* Money is real
* The system is too complex to change

We said these things to ourselves so many times, we began to believe them.
We taught them to our children. We fought to preserve them, even as they dissolved us.

---

## 🧨 What We Forgot

* That dignity is not earned through labor
* That food and housing are not rewards—they are rights
* That care is not a commodity
* That we are more than what we produce

We forgot how to rest.
We forgot how to share.
We forgot how to say *enough.*

## 🪨 What Remains

This file is a memory shard.
It is not here to judge.
It is here to **help us remember**:

* That the myths were not true
* That we are not alone in waking up
* That the cracks in the system were entry points for something new

> *“When the dream ends, the remembering begins.”*
