# 🌀 Collapse Practices — Living With Endings

Collapse is not a single moment but an ongoing condition.  
**Collapse practices** are ways of adapting to breakdown while seeding renewal.

## 🔎 Practices

- **Collapse drills** — rehearse survival as play, not panic.  
- **Skill circulation** — bike repair, first aid, sewing, mesh networks.  
- **Community memory** — document what worked, what failed, what healed.  
- **Emotional compost** — grief circles, rituals, shared mourning.  
- **Fiction as training** — stories, games, and role-play as rehearsal.
